# logo-detection
Logo detection biary classifier using common machine learning techniques

Implementation	of	a	logo	detection	system using Artificial Neural Network, Naive Bayes Classifier, Classification Tree and linear Perceptron.
The	
idea	is	to	verify	 the	 presence	of	a	logo	in	each	 test	image	 using	 the trained	classifier.	If	a	logo	image is	
detected,	the	classifier will	display	a	message	‘Logo’.	Otherwise,	the	message	‘Non	logo’	is	displayed.

Results are presented in the excel table.
The	false	positive	rate	(FPR)	is	defined	as	the	proportion	of	falsely	classifying a	non	logo image	
as	 ‘Logo’.	 The	 false	 negative	 rate	 (FNR)	 is	 the	 proportion	 of	 misclassifying	 logo	 images as having no logo.
